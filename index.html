                    <p>My name is Ying Chun Lin, or you can called me Jean.</p> 
                    <p>I'm currently a Research Assistant at <a href="http://netdbncku.cannerapp.com/">NetDB</a> at <a href="http://web.ncku.edu.tw/bin/home.php?Lang=en" target="_blank">National Cheng Kung University</a> (NCKU). I have received M.S. in Computer Science at NCKU. As a programmer, I have worked many kinds of projects related to web and data analytics. Interested by the knowledge hidden in data, I join <a href="http://bigdatalab.cs.nctu.edu.tw/newwebpa/index.php" target="_blank">Big Data Analytics Lab</a> where we mainly focus on the research about data mining and machine learning.</p>
                    <p>My research interests are in data mining and machine learning. I am fascinated by how to find the valuable knowledge from the abundance of data and further improve people’s life.  Today, the information around us is too much to consume. Motivated by the information explosion, I recently focus on how to filter the information around us and help us to make better choices.  My research has three perspectives: (1) developing new mining algorithms to extract valuable information from data, (2) designing recommending algorithms for different application to help people make better decisions, and (3) proposing novel learning models to come up with better strategies to solve a real-world problem. I have paid a lot of efforts in the three folds for the past few years.
