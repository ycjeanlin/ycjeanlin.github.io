                    <p>My name is Ying Chun Lin, or you can called me Jean.</p> 
                    <p>I'm currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/" target="_blank">Purdue University</a> in West Lafayette, IN, USA. Currently, I am working with <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/neville/" target="_blank">Prof. Jennifer Neville</a> on how to detect fake news through user behavior among social networks. My research interests are in data mining and machine learning, specifically generative models, statistical inference in graphs, and recommender systems.</p>

                    <p>I am fascinated by how to find the valuable knowledge from the abundance of data and further improve people’s life. Today, the information around us is too much to consume. Motivated by the information explosion, I recently focus on how to filter the information around us and help us to make better choices.  My research has three perspectives: (1) developing new mining algorithms to extract valuable information from data, (2) designing recommending algorithms for different application to help people make better decisions, and (3) proposing novel learning models to come up with better strategies to solve a real-world problem. I have paid a lot of efforts in the three folds for the past few years.
